# 0x09. React Redux reducer+selector

Project developed by Juan Esteban Correa PÃ©rez as part of the Web Stack specialization program at Holberton School.

It's purpose is to help the student understand:

The purpose of a reducer and the role it plays within your application<br>
Why a reducer should stay as pure as possible<br>
Why mutations should not happen within a reducer<br>
The use of Immutable within the reducer<br>
The use of Normalizr within the app<br>
Selectors: what they are and when to use them<br>
